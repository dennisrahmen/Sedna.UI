/* ── The symbol's tables ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   What ISO/IEC 18004 fixes for each of the forty versions and four error correction
   levels: how many error correction codewords each block carries, and how many blocks
   the codewords are split into. Indexed by version; index 0 is unused. Everything else
   the encoder needs — the size, the alignment pattern centres, the data capacity — is
   computed from the version.
